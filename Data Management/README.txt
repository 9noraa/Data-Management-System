Project goal: Create data management system using asp.net framework. I used a system with music and movies as well as reviews for each.

Development: Used the asp.net framework on visual studio. Used the CS_ABET code along as the baseline. My static class media has variables for
the title, artist or director, genre and run time. This interacts with the controller program. The controller program interacts with the front end html
and css. The front end programs app.js and index.html get user input and processes it.

Execution: All code was executed using visual studio 2019 asp.net framework. Local host using the Internet Information Services (IIS).
